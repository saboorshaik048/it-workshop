       		Abstract. This is a LATEX template for 18.821, which you can
       		use for your own reports.
       
       \centering
       \section{INTRODUCTION}
       This brief document shows some examples of the use of LATEX and
       indicates some special features of the Math Lab report style. The \textcolor{blue}{\underline{
       course website}} contains links to several LATEX manuals.
       End the introduction by describing the contents of the paper sec­
       tion by section, and which team member(s) wrote each of them. For
       instance, Section 6 discusses referencing, and is written by P. Gurps.
       	\section{LATEX Examples}
       	Here are some ways of producing mathematical symbols. Some are
       	package which
       	pre-deﬁned either in LATEX or in the AMS a
       	this document	loads. For instance, sums and integrals, $\sum_{i=1}^{n}$ 1=n, $\int_{0}^{n}$ xdx=$\frac{n^2}{2}$ We’ve deﬁned a few other symbols the start of the document, for instance N, Q, Z, R. You can make marginal notes for yourself or your
       	co-authors like this:
       	Unﬁnished here?
       	If you want to typeset equations, there are many choices, with or
       	without numbering:
       	\[\int_{0}^{1} xdx=\frac{1}{2}\]
       	\begin{flushleft}
       		or
       	\end{flushleft}
       	
       	\[\sum_{i=1}^{infinite}i=-\frac{1}{2}\]
       	\begin{flushleft}
       		or
       	\end{flushleft}
       
       1-1+1-..=$\frac{1}{2}$

       \end{figure}
       
       \vspace{1cm}
       
       If you want a number for an equation, do it like this:
       \begin{flushleft}
       	(1)\centering
  	$\lim_{n->infinite}$ \[\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k^2}=\frac{\pi}{6}\].
       \end{flushleft}
       	This can then be referred to as (1), which is much easier than keeping
       	track of numbers by hand. To group several equations, aligning on the
       	= sign, do it like this:
       
       		\[x1+2x2+3x3=7\]
       		\hspace{2cm} \[y=mx+c\]
       		\hspace{4cm}\[4x-9\]
       
       You can easily embed hyperlinks into the output .pdf document:
       \textcolor{blue}{\underline{click here}} for example.
       \section{Images}
       Figure 1 is an example of a .pdf image put into a ﬂoating environ­
       ment, which means LaTeX will draw it wherever there’s enough space
       left in your manuscript. Look at the .tex original to see how to insert
       a ﬁgure like this.
       \section{Theorems and such}
       An example of a “conjecture environment” is given below, in Con­
       jecture \textcolor{blue}{ 4.1.} Theorems, lemmas, propositions, deﬁnitions, and such all
       use the same command with the appropriate name changed. In fact,\\\

       these environments.\\

    \textit{(Vaght’s Conjecture). Let T be a countable com­
       plete theory. If T has fewer than 20 many countable models (up to
       isomorphism), then it has countably many countable model}\\
   \textbf{Theorem 4.2}
   \textit{When it rains it pours.\\
   	Proof. Well, yes.}
   
   \section{Filetypes used by LaTeX}
   You will write your text as a .tex ﬁle using any text editor (though
   WYSIWYG editors are troublesome). Traditionally one then runs
   LATEX and obtains a .dvi ﬁle, which can be viewed on the screen using a
   dvi viewer. To include images, and then prepare the ﬁle for printing or
   submission, one typically translates the .dvi into either .ps (Postscript)
   or .pdf (Adobe PDF).
   Your report will be submitted as a .pdf document. The pdflatex
   command produces a .pdf ﬁle directly from a .tex ﬁle. This command
   works well with included .pdf ﬁles, but does not handle .eps ﬁles.\\
   An .eps ﬁle can be converted to a .pdf ﬁle by viewing it and saving
   as a .pdf ﬁle, or by ps2pdf filename.eps, which produces
   filename.pdf. Under MikTeX with WinEdt, all necessary commands
   will appear under “Accessories” in the WinEdt menu.\\
   Finally, Matlab can be made to produce .eps ﬁles by typing\\
   print -deps filename\\
   \hspace{1cm}at the prompt.
   \section{Quoting sources}
   In your work, keep notes of the literature you’ve used, including
   websites. Cite the references you use; failure to do so constitutes pla ­giarism. Every bibliography item should be referenced somewhere in
   the paper. Quote as precisely as possible: [\textcolor{blue}{1}], pages 76–78] rather than
   [\textcolor{blue}{1}]. [\textcolor{blue}{2}] was a useful background reference, too\\.
